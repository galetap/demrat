Description: Package allows to predict growth rate, crude birth rate and total fertility rate for skeletal samples using age-at-death ratios computer from number of skeletons in two age-at-death categories. Prediction is based on regression model that is derived from a unique set of reference skeletal samples of the same size as the cemetery sample under study.
