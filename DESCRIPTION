Description: The package enables the prediction of growth rate, crude birth rate, and total fertility rate for skeletal samples by using age-at-death ratios computed from the number of skeletons in two age-at-death categories. The prediction is based on a regression model derived from a unique set of reference skeletal samples of the same size as the cemetery sample under study.
